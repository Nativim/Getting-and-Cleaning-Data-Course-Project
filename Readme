Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo has been created as part of the Coursera "Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project".

The project consist on downloading specified files to the working directory so code can be writting in R to manipulate the data and 
produce a clean data set.
The data provided for the assignement measures different values captured by an accelerometer and gyroscopeon on a smartphone and related
to six different activities (i.e. walking, sitting).

The code combines the different data sets provided (train, test, variables and activity names) and manipulate to them properly label the 
varaibles and factors used to summarise the data (by activity and subject).
The outcome of the code is the generation of a data set that shows the average value for each activity and subject. This outcome is written
to a file in the working directory.
